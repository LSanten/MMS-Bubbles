# The relationship between working with oneself and working together

we can only work with others if we work know how to work with ourselves • the swirls can only interact when they exist on both ends • every swirl tornado swirls around a still center, just like real tornados

we need to learn how to "work with ourselves" which is the action that arises out of the compression. i keep coming back to learning how "work with ourselves" - it seems essential in contributing to change but we mostly get taught knowledge but does not set us up to learn how to take notes, process emotions, explore ideas, deal with frustration in our work & life
