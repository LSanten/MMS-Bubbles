# if rent is low, businesses can sell for different prices if they also practice transparency and democratic shaping
Small businesses are also a deeply democratic expression of micro-needs. Like little sensors for market holes. Sadly, they currently need pretty large amounts of funding. I really think that rent should be reduced here. Rent seems to make everything expensive. Most businesses die because they cannot be profitable. If they paid less rent, they could sell things for less. All of this requires a practice of transparency. (from a canvas convo with Casey)
