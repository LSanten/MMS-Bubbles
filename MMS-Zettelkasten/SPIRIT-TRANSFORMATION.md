# spiritual transformation 

"spiritual transformation [on the other hand] is not about the what, it is about the who” (Tubali 2019) • who are we really? • our collective ability to walk toward systems that heal our social-ecological systems seems to arise out of the transformation of our separate ego-identities into a body of consciousness knowing that we are everyone together" (Santen 2023 C-10)
