Judith: "du kanst etwas veraendern und die veraenderung geniessen"

adaptive systems change is spiritual work on a collective level. how can we collectively work through our karma so we make conscious choices? 
One may relate these choices to moral & value sets of ecological justice etc. [[ECO-JUSTICE]]
