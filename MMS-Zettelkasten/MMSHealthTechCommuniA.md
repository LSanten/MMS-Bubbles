# A proposal

- ## fun way to bring this message across:
Apple advertisment with their fonts and style sharing:
"We at Apple care about the longevity of our products their impact on our planet. For that reason, we are all working together to keep the health of our products as high as possible"

## how I would change the interface
allow users to choose between: 
- charge as fast as possible ("I need to leave soon")
- keep at a specific percentage best for battery health around half-charged ("I need to work from home for a few days")
- charge my battery as slowly/healthily as possible within certain time frame ("I need to leave tomorrow morning with a full charge")

- do not make this decision for the user when to charge the battery full all the way
- do not always charge as fast as possible - let the user choose - #autonomy #care


                                                       

## base ideas 

*health*: the priority of working together is to ensure that we all are healthy & well. So it matters that we talk to each other how we can contriubte to each other's health. Sadly, this is not the case in many parts of our society. One striking emergence of this not-caring about health is the fact **no company tells us how to take care of their products**. 


## Evidence
Microsoft shares about 650 words on battery health [1]. This is decent but short if we consider that the user has the hightest ability to influence the laptop's health via battery care. 

Apple [2], similar to Mircrosoft, emphasize that it's important to keep the battery healthy but do not give the user any option to control the cycles themselves. 
**They provide plenty of options for reducing the energy usage of the product (brightness, things plugged into laptop) but do not talk about battery health management besides turning on the setting**

They always say to store it at 50% so we don't we keep it at 50% unless we need to need a high charge? [3]
