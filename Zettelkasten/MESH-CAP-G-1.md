# list of tools and practices useful and necessary for an organized work flow
This is a list of tools that are helpful to manage our knowledge and insights as always learning and growing thinkers and doers. Below is a 


- It helps to know that citation managers exist and which ones are good and free: [Zotero](https://www.zotero.org/) is great, free, and open source. Great industry standard for saving resources, creating citations lists, annotations on papers and images within papers
- This is an introduction to organizing your personal knowledge with slips (also called Zettelkasten): https://christiantietze.de/posts/2020/10/zettelkasten-introduction/ - this can be really really helpful to manage large amounts of insights and knowledge that relate to each other in a simple way (like mine [over here](https://github.com/LSanten/MMS-Bubbles/tree/main/Zettelkasten))
- This is an article that explains how a citation manager can be used in fusion with the "zettelkasten" knowledge management approach: [An Updated Academic Workflow: Zotero & Obsidian](https://medium.com/@alexandraphelan/an-updated-academic-workflow-zotero-obsidian-cffef080addd)
- Miro (or Figma) are online tools to create mind maps, sticky notes etc... There are very few mind map tools out there. It really helps to have access to one! To both of these you can have access with an educational accocunt! (maybe lie about the lenght of your program to have access for longer)
- Canva is a great tool to create presentations!

## Looking at the work of MESH as an apprenticeship. What work tips would a *master of MESH* give you? 
You don't know the value of something that you have never practiced. Unless someone introduces you to having the tools below around yourself, you wonâ€™t get them. More money to spend... Yes, but it's worth it! We used to work with paper for decades. Now laptops are here and we are deprived of creative work flows on our desks. We need to re-engage this practice. This collection is quick tool-focused re-angement. 

Learning how to pour out your thoughts & explore your creative source may require more than materials. In the end, it's about how one work with their creativity. But it is incredibly difficult to be creative without writing things on paper, moving them around, and shaping a physical space. 

**If I learned anything from design school, it is that shaping our work space with artefacts of our thoughts and ideas is essential for progression on a design/research journey.**


## Practical intervention in the form of introuction to tools: intro to creative (design) work:

- Heavy duty sticky notes
- Butcher paper 
- Sharpies
- Colored pens
- A normal sized notebook
- A small sized notebook for lists
- Guidance/recommendations regarding notetaking
- Maybe: white board paper with adhesive backing
- Maybe: cork plates for pinning up notes and ideas

(Different idea: At the beginning of the program, every student receives hard copies of every professors two most favorite articles or papers. Students can opt in to receive them. )
