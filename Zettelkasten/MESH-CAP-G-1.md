## Looking at the work of MESH as an apprenticeship. What work tips would you master give you? 
Unless someone introduces you to having this stuff around yourself, you wonâ€™t get it. You don't know the value of something that you have never practicced. Learning how to pour out your thoughts & explore your creative source may require more than materials. Raising awareness regarding tools & practices would fit well into the intro course but should be taken up in other courses. 


**Practical intervention in the form of introuction to tools: intro to creative (design) work:**

- Heavy duty sticky notes
- Butcher paper 
- Sharpies
- Colored pens
- A normal sized notebook
- A small sized notebook for lists
- Guidance/recommendations regarding notetaking
- Maybe: white board paper with adhesive backing
- Maybe: cork plates for pinning up notes and ideas

Different idea: At the beginning of the program, every student receives hard copies of every professors two most favorite articles or papers. Students can opt in to receive them.
