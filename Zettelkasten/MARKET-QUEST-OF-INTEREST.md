# IDEA: create a market to create space to surface meaningful "bubbles" of interest
This market could allow people to share the following:

**what you have in your baggage:**
- offers 
- needs

**what arises during the event:**
- questions
- insights
- ideas/proposals

the list above is inspired by my design prototype for my personal "bubble" sharing and collaboration website.

## Concepts embedded in this market practice

### synthesis of collective wisdom, struggle, urges etc - like Chat GPT
