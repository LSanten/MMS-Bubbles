# Tangible creations list
Here I collect things I want and need to create. They are partially deliverables for my capstone, but they don't have to be. 

## TEAR 1: Highest tear: i can do right now and use for my research/design
--> create the map of capstone projects in the works of my cohort and ask students from other cohorts if it would be helpful to have connections in that space (see the map and engage with these people)

--> a list of tools and practices useful and necessary for an organized work flow: zettelkasten/obsidian [[MESH-CAP-G1]]

--> living 

## TEAR 2: very keystone pieces of longer timeline relevance 
--> a document of recommendations to improve MESH concretely: e.g. reative work practice advice 

## TEAR 3: 
--> a layout for transparent and vulnerable reflections on shortcomings within projects.

Visualizer based on simple markdown files
    Maybe to streamline offers and needs settings?
    Maybe to create bubbles of epistemological points?
