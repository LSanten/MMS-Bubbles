# Tangible creations list
Here I collect things I want and need to create. They are partially deliverables for my capstone, but they don't have to be. 

## TEAR 1: Highest tear: i can do right now and use for my research/design
--> create the **map of capstone projects in the works** of my cohort and ask students from other cohorts if it would be helpful to have connections in that space (see the map and engage with these people)

--> REQUIRES INVESTIGATION: **a map of trusted co-ops and work businesses for a just, regenerative economy** with the focus on local supply chains and networks. (is there a need for this? Bogdan mentioned that it's helpful to know if a certain plumbing co-op is actually trustworthy etc.)

## TEAR 2: very keystone pieces of longer timeline relevance 
--> a document of recommendations to improve MESH concretely: e.g. reative work practice advice 

## TEAR 3: 
--> a layout for transparent and vulnerable reflections on shortcomings within projects.


## To add to other tears

Visualizer based on simple markdown files
    Maybe to streamline offers and needs settings?
    Maybe to create bubbles of epistemological points?
Tools for omprakash
    Non-linear communication interfaces
Concepts for an engineering hub
Practices for ESJP

## Interface ideas for interviews

### non-linear communication blackboard style

### seeing each others projects on a map

### saving semi-relevant
--> a list of tools and practices useful and necessary for an organized work flow: zettelkasten/obsidian [[MESH-CAP-G-1]]
