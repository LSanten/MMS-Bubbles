# We need to consider intellectual property as a material in the circula econoomy - it needs to circulate among the whole ecosystem 

Circular economy certificates and LCA consultancies do not consider the potential of cooperating with other organizations

We love to refer to the positive sides of circulating materials for a long time (because it actually saves energy and resources). What about the fact that intellectual property could be circulated in the economy to save massive amounts of resources? Intellectual property rights create totally unnecessary competition and resource loss. I see the pattern that circular economy certificates or assessments do not critically examine the potential to cooperate and save far more resources down the line.Â 

Essentially, all these certificates and consultancies still operate under the traditional paradigms of capitalism = competition, entitlement to resources, land, labor. 

#MMS-seed : here, I could create a graphic that compares how numerous companies do reserach on the exact same product. There could be a row of various companies investing resources and people into the creating the same product. Now think about all the resources freed and avoided if they all shared their insights because they are united by a shared vision to create a great product. 
We know that large-scale research planning and sharing is largely beneficial to innovation, however the market does not favor this planned research, only governments do it. Refer to the massive influence of planned and coordinated military reserach on the world-wide economy [[MILIT-A]]
