# Solving problems can never be the solution for long-term healing

On a deeper level, I argue that we cannot solve the problem by looking at problems. We should look at what forms of life we aspire to. What ways of being with each other do we aspire to? This very important because even if we solve a problem, new problems will arise. They will arise because we haven't changed our moral and habitual conditioning or the base structure. Only when we grow into new states of being can the root cause of the symptom be fixed. This idea relates to Singers point that we are morally in a somewhat evil situation and we need to unlearn our old habits. We also need make visible hidden mental structures.
