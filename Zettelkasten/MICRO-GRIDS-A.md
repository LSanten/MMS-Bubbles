[1] - a microgrid with two solar panel arrays and a microhydro generator (very small water turbine). The "arduino control unit" can be ignored. It was an additional add-on to monitor the battery voltage to prevent battery health decay. 


## Aspects of energy sovereignty projects...
I created this graphic to illustrate the variety of dimensions that are crucial when working with communities to realize their **energy sovereignty**.

staying warm --> Heaters require a lot of energy. It tends to be better to use gas or oil for heaters unless you have a large system.
