# Project ideas & challenges for capstone

Education

- give students the ability to raise questions, insights, projects without guidance and allow for emergence of cooperation within the teaching container. This means to help students to build the practice of self-originated work, self-reliant relationships, and meaning-based communication. 

Research projects

- how do Olin and MESH give students the option to pool from collective resources? How do we stay connected to work on meaningful problems?
- what is everyone up to that others could tune into? 

MESH

- ask every student at the end of their MESH capstone for what resons they would like to be contacted or if they need help in a particular field. 
- create a map of MESH projects and how they relate. do research with students by asking them about their needs and how they could intertwine with other's help
