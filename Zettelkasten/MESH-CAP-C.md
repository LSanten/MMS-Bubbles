# IDEA: A visual space to create and share, organize, archive and collaborate on snippets

like this website does for tech projects https://hackaday.io/project/192688-the-open-book


## A bulletin board is one way to visualize it 
Bulletin board or living room for emotions, needs, and offers on a virtual plaza

Imagine a visual 2-dimensional interface (similar to miro) but organized more neatly. There is a row, like a bulletin board, where people post their emotions. These emotions start to fade after a week or two.

There is another row for un-met needs. They can range from "I need help talking with my mom about Palestine" to "I seek conversation buddy for my capstone." And a third row is about offerings. Mahtaub, for instance, has offered in the past to be a conversation buddy to anyone who would like to talk. Essentially, we have a bulletin for our micro-village. It's like a marketplace or plaza.Â 

ALSO ADD IMAGE DRAWINGS FROM OUR ZOOM TALK WITH MICHELLE, MAHTAUB ETC 

## A 3D house with a living room, kitchen, and garden can contain spaces for various forms of snippets drawing on metaphors 

- cooking up ideas in the kitchen 
- Cry corner with napkins
- Pillow corner to hold each other when we need support
- If i need resources - shopping list for resources  

#todo : create drawings of a living room with metaphorical spaces that allow for  engagement around a variety of questions, ideas, resources, needs, offers etc...
