# Notice how we justify killing
I am interested in the intersection of logic and violence as they conditioning each other. When we go into our heads and start to argue with logic about destruction, we naturally move away from reality. 

We know that Western humans mostly use their left hemisphere to engage with reality. Actions arisen from the left hemispere of our brain show very different patterns compared with the right hemisphere (from [[MCGILCHRIST2021-VID]]): 

  "when we see the signs of flattened out arguments devoid of emotional and spiritual connection in a philosophical argument, we know that this is the left hemisphere speaking" 
      
The left hemisphere of our brain is used to get things and manipualte dead matter while the right hemisphere is used to relate to the living world and the implicit side of reality. 

The effort to objectify reality and squish it into numbers and logical building blocks is a core component of the qunatitative scientific method. Also consider how in the English language, the subjects acts on an object.
