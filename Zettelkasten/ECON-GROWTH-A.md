# Neoliberalism did not even achieve bigger growth, instead it shifted capital from lower classes to upper classes 

## no greater econ growth
"Aggregate growth rates stood at 3.5 percent or so in the 1960s and even during       the troubled 1970s fell to only 2.4 percent. The subsequent global growth rates       of 1.4 percent and 1.1 percent for the 1980s and 1990s, and a rate that barely       touches 1 percent since 2000, indicate that neoliberalism has broadly failed to       stimulate worldwide growth.[14]" (Harvey 2006 p.33)

## the top gets more 
"Other data show that the top 0.1 percent of income earners increased their share of the national income from 2 percent in 1978 to more than 6 percent by 1999. [in the US]" (Harvey 2006 p.28)

"another measure shows that the ratio of the median compensation of workers to the salaries of chief executive officers increased from just over thirty to one in 1970 to more than four hundred to one by 2000." (Harvey 2006 p.28)
