# An organization that certifies circular economy endavours on sliding scales among various rubrics


Transparency is crucial! https://www.omprakash.org/blog/just-energy-hub-exploration


Alyssa Eslick and Shai are interested in this. 


I see a sliding scale or range could be very helpful. There could be all sorts of badges and sliders that will be re-evaluated. That way, people like us could also more easily understand which org needs help. I'd love to see such a website for bad companies as well. They would get terrible rankings and it would further increase trust into small orgs.
