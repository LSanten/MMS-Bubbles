## Questions that inform this container

### shaping policies or snippets
- How do we as citizens, students and facilitators shape things like project ideas together? #snippets of thoughts, ideas, insights, questions, proposals. 
- How do we make sure that the media we create is an actual medium to connect a person with a person? A medium for movement? 

### interconnecting forces 
- inspired by simren, how do all the various groups and co-ops interconnect?
- how do they know of each others' needs and offers?
- How do we connect efforts? Create collective snippets of visions and movement?
