# Interface or consulting hub to interconnect local businesses with other orgs to share and satisfy offers and needs

it's like the facilitation of a local industrial ecology network or eco-industrial park as seen in Kalundborg, Denmark [1] or as described in chapter 6 of Sustainable Energy Transitions (Mulvaney 2020).

*from converation with Casey L*: a medium that connects things. I'm really wondering is how to help people be integrated into a strong market. For instance, all of these businesses need local resources. They need to come from somewhere. Local manufacturing will become more and more important. We all have needs & offers. You could connect a place to local tea makers while the local tea makers bring their left over leafs to the local paper maker. And so on. There needs to be a place to connect needs & offers that way. I am interested in this form of streamlining communication from a manufacturing and local activist perspective. Check out my post about offers & needs markets, also: https://www.omprakash.org/blog/just-transition-blog-reflection--2Links to an external site. 

*also remember* the drawing I shared with Wyatt and group about helping people see offers and needs in our environment
