# if we believe, we can't think

"It is my experience both as an artist and as ateacher that when we move out on faith into the act of creation, the universe is able to adnvance. It is a little like opening the gate at the top of a field irrigation system. Once we remove the blocks, the flow moves in. 

Again, I do not ask you to believe this. In order for this creative emergence to happen, you don't have to believe in God. I simply ask you to observe and nte this process as it ut unfolds. In effect, you will be midwiving and witnessing your own creative progression.

Creativity is an experience - to mye eye, a spiritual experience. It does not matter which wa you think of it: creativity leading to spirituality or spirituality leading to creativity. In fact, I do not make a distinction between the two. In the face of such experience, the whole question of belief is rendered obsoloete. As Carl Jung answered the question of belief late in his life. 'I don't believe. I know.'
