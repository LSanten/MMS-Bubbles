Education

- give students the ability to raise questions, insights, projects without guidance and allow for emergence of cooperation within the learning container. This means to help students to build the practice of self-originated work, self-reliant relationships, and meaning-based communication. 

Research projects

- how do Olin and MESH give students the option to pool from collective resources? How do we stay connected to work on meaningful problems?
- what is everyone up to that others could tune into? 
- what practices do students need when they learn over the internet and with large amounts of info? 

MESH

- ask every student at the end of their MESH capstone for what resons they would like to be contacted or if they need help in a particular field. 
- create a map of MESH projects and how they relate. do research with students by asking them about their needs and how they could intertwine with other's help 

THE PRACTICE OF LEARNING WITH YOURSELF

- **how do I work with myself**? [[SPIRIT-WORK-A]] 
- how do I take notes & screenshots? (research potential with students here)
- how do I keep the info for my future self and can create on top down the line?
- what citation manager do I use?
- tools to make life simpler: invert on chrome, google scholar, the archive (or obsidian), cleanShot
