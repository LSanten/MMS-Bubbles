# Use all times square screens as monitors for city systems such as waste flows, monetary streams, consumption patterns

I tend to contemplate the invisible nature of waste in cities. Where does it go? Why is there no public education spot in a city that shows us where things go? Imagine the New York Times Square being used as a report center for the citizens. There could be graphics that show waste streams, consumption trends, and monetary flows. Where is money being invested? 

A lot of the waste problem goes deeper than awareness, but I find this part particularly interesting. How to give the community insights into how the system operates? The parts of the system that remain hidden are able to control the system without any feedback to be changed.

## portal to connect worlds
Imagine a portal that shoots out messages from people working on Indonesia trash mountain directly to a place in San Francisco. There is a live-stream camera. People can directly communicate and ask someone questions who deals with our stuff on the other side of the planet.
