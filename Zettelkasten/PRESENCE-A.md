# if we are present in our world and truly feel what is in as and around us, we know what to do and how to transform and change ourselves

We can connect to a deeper form of embodied and manifested knowledge. We can connect to our feelings and the pain. When we feel all of this and stay present, we connect to a deep knowledge that guides our work. This is a sort of feedback from the whole system to a partial organ (a person). It relates to the effect that when we truly listen to feedback and establish feedback loops, our work flows [[EFFORT-BROKEN-FEEDBACK]] (Brander 2023).

From [[MESH-EJ-THESIS]]:

"through connecting with & observing the world inside us &
around us we may become aware of the interconnected,
impermanent nature of reality • the realization that we all
die & are part of the same inexplicable something may bring
about compassion with others by feeling connected through
love & suffering (Tolle 1999) • through this deep insight
into the nature of reality, our understanding of who we are
changes and allows us to operate from a new place (Tubali
2019)"
(Santen 2023)
