# The system's capacity to be conducive to health is re-created in the systems that emerge from it  

This is the autopoietic (self-reproducing) effect of social systems. As these systems are self-referential, the new structures they create carry on the [[ONTOLOGICAL-PRIMITIVES]] 


formerly called #MMSHealthAutopoiesis



## therefore, only people (or systems) who live balanced themselves, can truly do the work to balance our social-ecological systems

#comment from my friends:
Soon Il: "Yeah i think both quotes resonated with me-in particular the first quote about how engineers disconnected from their own needs wonâ€™t produce technologies that can heal the planet -i was reminded of my undergrad engineering experience and how disconnected i felt from myself during that time. I felt that the culture in engineering felt very much colder and very separate from oneself, or that may have been just my experience in engineering at the least"

## My illustration to convey how the healthy conditioning of the environment leads to the emergence of behaviors and relationships conducive to a thriving existence for living beings

## Monica Dennis's "Wheel of Oppression and Liberation"
This framework emphasizes how oppression & colonization were only possible due to the disconnect between mind and body [[SOMATIC-HEAL-WHITENESS]].

By re-connecting to and remembering our (collective) selves we can tune into embodied knowledge and power to create deep change ([[OPP-LIB-PRAC-A]])
