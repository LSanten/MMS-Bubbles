# It is not individuals but the structures through which they communicate that shape our world 
Every construct we use is a structure that inherently influeces how communication is accepted and rejected and when it emerges (acceptance). Communication is differnt from consciousness. Communication can never be true to consciousness yet we need it because we aren't psychically connected to know what others experience in their heads. 

Therefore, we might want to think about communication structures that allow for flow of communication that is conducive to specific types of communication we would like to see emerge. (structure conditions behavior; specific environments are conducive to specific forms of emergence)

Excerpt from [[MESH-EJ-THESIS]] (page C-6):
Niklas Luhmann “defended the quite novel thesis that, while social systems are self-organizing and self-re- producing systems, they do not consist of individuals—or roles or even acts, as commonly conceptualized—but exclusively of communications” (Geyer 2001) • I find this theory interesting because it points at the universal nature of information transfer • I might reason quickly that all forms of roles or concrete actions are artificial containers which prevent the ultimate communication with everything • but they also streamline communication because relating to the whole world can be quite overwhelming • this idea feeds into my emphasis on **integrating communication of more aspects of our lives into the collective sense-making (com- munication) process to arrive at deeper change**
