# It is not individuals but the structures through which they communicate that shape our world 
Therefore, we might want to think about communication structures that allow for flow from more places to other places. 

Excerpt from [[MESH-EJ-THESIS]] (page C-6):
Niklas Luhmann “defended the quite novel thesis that, while social systems are self-organizing and self-re- producing systems, they do not consist of individuals—or roles or even acts, as commonly conceptualized—but exclu- sively of communications” (Geyer 2001) • I find this theory interesting because it points at the universal nature of information transfer • I might reason quickly that all forms of roles or concrete actions are artificial containers which prevent the ultimate communication with everything • but they also streamline communication because relating to the whole world can be quite overwhelming • this idea feeds into my emphasis on **integrating communication of more aspects of our lives into the collective sense-making (com- munication) process to arrive at deeper change**
