# INSIGHT: it is more enticing and connecting to have homework instructions that ask about "why we are interested in something" and to learn about other humans than only focus on external, far-away knowledge

#communication #instructions #relationships 

**myself from a convo with david**: your sentence about why you chose this case study made it much more enticing to read. Suddenly, I have a reason to care about your writing because it relates to you as a complex human. I am interested in humans and relationships a lot - and probably more than abstract far-away things. 

So I reason, that it could be a nice educational twist for instructors to ask why we care about things instead of merely asking about the "what" . It relates to my idea to ask students to describe the feelings they feel before they "have to write" and maybe even what they struggle with in life right now.
