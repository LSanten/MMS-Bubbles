# spiritual transformation 

"spiritual transformation [on the other hand] is not about the what, it is about the who” (Tubali 2019) • who are we really? • our collective ability to walk toward systems that heal our social-ecological systems seems to arise out of the transformation of our separate ego-identities into a body of consciousness knowing that we are everyone together" (Santen 2023 C-10)


Especially the relationsation that I am connected to everyone brings about the values of *care, cooperation, and consent*. How would I not value the needs and boundaries of other living beings and try to work with them if I truly understood that we are all part of the same big organism? Would the brain kill the stomach in greed for more oxygen?
