# How to define prosperity (in the context of degrowth)
"Conventionally prosperity has been understood as  opulence  – an increase in  consumption, incomes and wealth. Another possibility is to de fi  ne prosperity in  terms of  subjective wellbeing  – utility or happiness. Tim Jackson, however, prefers  a concept put forward by Amartya Sen. Prosperity should be de fi  ned in terms of  the  capabilities  that people have to  fl  ourish.  How well are people able to function  in a given context? (Jackson 2009: 34)
[...]

The term  “prosperity” derives from the Latin words “pro” and “speres,” which means for  (what we) hope. Our capabilities to  fl  ourish – to be well nourished, healthy and  secure, to take part in the life of the community, and to be free to do or to be what  we value – corresponds to this original meaning. One measure that is used to  assess these capabilities is the  Human Development Index  (HDI) yearly presented  in the Human Development Report published by the UNDP. Another could be the  Genuine Progress Indicator  (GPI) (both are presented in Chapter 5).

Jackson, however, thinks it is necessary to bind the capabilities by the limits set  by our ecological space. A society is prosperous only if people everywhere have  the capability to  fl  ourish in certain basic ways. "
