Ela Ben-Ur developed the design tool called the Innovators Compass (website [here](https://innovatorscompass.org/about)). The tool asks five questions to get unstuck during a design process or community gathering. The questions asked are: 
(I) People: Who is involved?
(II) Observation: What’s happening?
(III) Principles: What matters most?
(IV) Ideas: What ways are there?
(V) Experiments: What’s a step to try?
