# Streaming platform for music that shows you map of local artists around you

From convo with Casey L: It's hard to compete with the algorithms of spotify that everyone likes so much. I know artists would enjoy compensation. Here, I wonder why people would want to migrate. I think about community. There used to be dating apps that show you where people are. This was kind of exciting as you could go into the city and see who wants to date (lol - but it didn't work taht well IRL). but my point here is. i WOULD LOVE to see all the musicician right around me that make music. I'd be far more interested in listening to someone if I knew they lived two streets away from me... also, spotify doesn't have the option to host radios. I've always wanted to tune into my friends across the world as they listen to music. Just listen to exactly what they are listening too. Maybe they could even add some voice overs to broadcast to all their friends. 

My point is. Your idea is to support the artist community. Maybe creating interfaces that create community is the right way to go about it.
