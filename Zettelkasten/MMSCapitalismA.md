## Introduction to capitalism 
"Capitalism is an economic system in which  employers, using privately owned capital, hire wage labor to produce commodities for the purpose of making a profit" (Andersson & Eriksson 2010, p.125). Capitalist businesses often rely on the governing structures of **workplace dictatorship**, in which the owner of the company or business has the right to tell the worker what to do (Wright 2019). This structure in itself creates a power divide and social division. These power structures pertrude throughout the globalized economy.
