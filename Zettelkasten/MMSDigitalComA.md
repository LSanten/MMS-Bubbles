# Communicating about communication 

- When I text you or ask you a question, you can choose to not respond. I invite you to only respond if you have the desire to do so. I do not feel offended if you don’t respond. There’s no urgency. I’ll let you know if there is urgency.
- Me asking to talk or meet doesn’t mean it needs to be in the next week or two. There’s no urgency. 
- I hope my requests to talk or meet fit into your life, if they don’t please feel absolutely free to take yourself as much time as you need. We can also schedule for long time into the future
- Please take your time responding to me. 
- I don’t feel hurt/ I have all the understanding if you forget to respond or respond late. I have done it countless times before. My longest was 6 months and never until today. 
- Michelle’s friend:  "**your value to me is not tied to the quickness to which you respond to my messages.**"
