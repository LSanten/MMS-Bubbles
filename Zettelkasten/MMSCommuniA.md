# Original intentions behind mostly.mutual.studio
I've been contemplating communication between friends, co-learners, and change-makers for several years. **How can I create a medium to facilitate "movement building" in my personal circles?** It's always been hard for me to share my thoughts appropriately with my friends and co-creators. I might have an old piece of academic writing somewhere. But how do I share it? And where is it again? 

I started an instagram account with the name @mostly.mutual.studio to start the intentional process of sharing & collecting *insights, concepts, creations, and proposals*. While I don't feel attached to instagram as a platform, I am attached to my creations because they create the building block for communicating my visions & insights. My goal is to host little snippets (or "bubbles", as I call them,) on my website to share them with others and invite people to work on them with me. 

This is a technical project as well as a research exploration. The first few sharings are more of archival nature. However, my plan is to create more generative & collaborative work down the road. 

Below is the slide that captures the original ideas behind this platform creation.
