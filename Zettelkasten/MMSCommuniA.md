# Original intentions behind mostly.mutual.studio
I've been contemplating communication between friends, co-learners, and change-makers for a while. It's always been hard for me to share my thoughts appropriately with my friends and co-creators.

I started an instagram account with the name @mostly.mutual.studio. While I don't feel attached to instagram as a platform, I am attached to my creations. My goal is to host little snippets (or "bubbles", as I call them,) on my website to share them with others and invite people to work on them with me. 

The first few sharings are more of archival nature. However, my plan is to create more generative & collaborative work down the road. 

Below is the slide that captures the original ideas behind this platform creation.
