I desire nourishing drinks during a long night of dancing. 

- tea to soothe my stomach & soul
    - adaptogen teas
    - mucus teas



- water with flavorless electrolites (ADD: lemon)


- alcohol free coktails with adaptogens for energy & resilience (NO: refined sugar)


- smoothies with protein 


- shot for strong flavors with spice, sweet, tangy:
    - tumeric orange shot with black pepper
