# Solving climate change means to transform relationships of power 

(I use 'solving climate change' synonomous with healing our social-ecological systems from unnecessary suffering, violence, and degredation.)

Gopal Dayaneni is the one whose words have left an imprint on me regarding the idea that *"the cause of the crisis is in the injustice"* so we need to *transform relationships of power*:

"You don't get to the place of earth system disruption without an enourmous amount of coercion" - "mountains don't blow up by themselves" "you need to control labor & capital" - Gopal Dayaneni @ Pachamama Conference 2023 
(disruption & coercion relate to [[EXTRACTION-A]])

He and Linda Vanasupa  have continuously pointed at the key-leverage point to address the cause of climate cahnge by re-learning and re-integrating the practice of the **values** *coopeartion, care, and consent*.
