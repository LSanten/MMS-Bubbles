# Communication "arises through a synthesis of three different selections, namely, selection of information, selection of the utterance of  this information, and a selective understanding or misunderstanding of this utterance and its information"



Luhmann  ’  s model decenters the subject, excluding the direct involvement  of the human (sender/ receiver) and replacing it with components that consist of  symbols, words or sentences (communicative media). These components give form  through the selection of information (taken from previous communication), utterance  (articulation of information) and understanding (as the difference between informa-  tion and utterance).
