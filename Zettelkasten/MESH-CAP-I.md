# What's my project about and how do I say it?

From Jon: **How do we MESH together in multiple disciplines so that we are ensuring that we remain compassionate towards others while accomplishing the goals we are trying to achieve?**  What I have learned in my previous years of working within many different engineering industries is that everyone has their own agenda and trying to coordinate all of those agendas so that the outcome is progressing towards the ultimate goal is a tough challenge.   I believe though that the lessons we have learned in these courses is that **we need to focus our attention to others and keep an open mind on all ideas that come**. 


From Marleigh: It seems the core aspirations of your project is to create a hub/space for a community to pursue the sharing of **knowledge, innovation, sustainable development, and socio-environmental justice**. In this case, it seems our differences could be our biggest strength, where individuals within the community can share unique knowledge, ideas, resources, experiences, insights, information, etc. This holds the potential to foster collaboration, organizations, movements, foundations, etc.; ultimately promoting positive growth and development. The options are truly limitless. Excited to see how your project develops and progresses.
