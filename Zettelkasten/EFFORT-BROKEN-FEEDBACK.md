# Effort is evidence for broken feedback loops

The insight that "effort is evidence for broken feedback loops" arrises from the *dynamically complex systems thinking* world (Brander 2023). It means that processes should flow naturally. If we push with too much force, it is a sign that the naturally emerging process is not seen. 

The reason for too much effort exerted is partially related to our mental models of linear relationships. We think that working more and working hard directly correlates proportionaly to a bigger outcome. 

## how is tuning into feedback different from effort-based pushing?
However, we might need to remember that if work put into context with its environemnt, we need to be attuned and listen to the voices that hint at continuing the work in a particular direction. For instance, we might start work on writing an essay about the nature of frogs. We can push out the essay and put much effort and energy into writing it fast. Instead, we can start it and take a break. We can go on with our life and stay attuned to reality. If the essay is of true importance, there will be natural *feedback* in our world to bring us back to this work. 

This form of work requires time, the ability to listen, and the ability to be present. The ability to be present directly helps us to tune into the work that is truly needed and act from a place of knowing - more words on this in [[PRESENCE-A]]. 

## Comments from my friends on this
Ciara: "**Without a united community, it takes great effort to convince anyone to do anything, and no one understands or cares why they are doing it. When the community is on the same page and they know to what extent their actions affect others as well as the ecosystem, there is much less effort needed to keep everyone living sustainably.** For example, many people are unaware that “flushable” wipes are simply that. They can be flushed. However, this does not mean they should be flushed as it makes the job for people at sewage and waste treatment plants much more difficult. Because the community is not properly educated on the extent of flushable wipes effects, there is much more effort needed in trying to combat big companies that advertise their wipes as flushable and get the community to understand that they are in fact hurtful to processes outside the immediate consumer’s house. This example can be expanded to recycling in general. So much recycled material has to be thrown out because certain items that are non-recyclable contaminate an entire bundle of possible recyclable items."
