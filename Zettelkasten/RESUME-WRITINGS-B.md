I hold this paper very close to my heart because it manifests my personal exploration of self-improvement & self-transformation with respect to environmental justice. If you want to read something that represents me, this paper it is. It is also set up for you to comment. I'd love to see your thoughts. (It is also design project as I formatted it myself.) 

First, I explore the historical context that has led to a world-wide state of destruction and oppression. Then, I share a variety of spiritual frameworks to address the root cause of violence & destruction.

If you are interested in a detailed analysis of why the scientific method has created separation, please refer to page B-3.

through connecting with & observing the world inside us & around us we may become aware of the interconnected, impermanent nature of reality • the realization that we all die & are part of the same inexplicable something may bring about compassion with others by feeling connected through love & suffering (Tolle 1999) • through this deep insight into the nature of reality, our understanding of who we are changes and allows us to operate from a new place (Tubali 2019)

I see an opportunity to liberate ourselves from destructive & oppressive social structures (social institutions and our personal selves) by integrating other forms of story telling, our emotions, our bodily experiences, our intuition, and connection to our inner source (Monica Dennis) into spaces that seek transformative change for everyone’s thriving (ecological justice) • the internal process is of importance because our body-mind-spirit complexes are the instruments through which communication & action emerge

our internal world reflects structures of external social systems (Scharmer 2015) • therefore, our inner world is a great place to start the process of self-transformation and self-improvement • the personal process will inevitably affect our social systems because our internal values and beliefs condition the social structures we create • since our social systems recreate themselves and the conditions for their emergence (Luhmann 1998), a high level of consciousness (personal & collective) of embedded values & beliefs in the system structures is essential in creating social systems conducive to a thriving world for all
