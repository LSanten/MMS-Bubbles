Entitlement

gopal dayaneni: entitlement is the infringement on the commons/ on public goods (instead we can govern our commons collectively - the tragedy of the commons is a myth if we cooperate [[TRAGEDY-COMMONS-A]])

dayaneni: "access to the enclosure should not be confused with liberation": e.g. access to an enclosed lawn still keeps the lawn enclosed
