# Summary of emissions of agriculture and livestock

Agriculture contributes about 25% of  all greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, and about 80% of  that comes from products of  animal agriculture such as meat, milk, and eggs. The agriculture industry has major impacts on the environment, as live-stock production accounts for 70% of  all agricultural land and 30% of  the land surface [...] Another 25% of  greenhouse gases are from electricity and heat. (Mulvaney 2020, p. 218 f.).
