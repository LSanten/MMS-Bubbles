# The connection between repairing consumer devices and human relationships

from a discussion post on MESH: "Hi Kevin, thanks for sharing your reflection so openly. I relate to you. It is oftentimes easier to do a new thing than to seriously consider the current one. I think this applies to many different areas. 

If you are in a relationship that doesn't go well, it can be easier to break up than to sit down and consider what to do with what you have. It is "easier" to buy a new product or date another random person. But throughout this, we lose the ability to work with what we have. 

We are culturally unexperienced in the practice of nurturing what we have and giving care to the things we have; look out for everyone's health around us. why does Apple not give us user settings to take care of their batteries properly? --> your battery should NEVER be below 30% if you can avoid it. if you don't use your laptop, it should be at 50%, and you shouldn't charge above 80% unless you want to use the full charge very soon. All these things damage our batteries, but there is no talking or informing from Apple's side and they don't give us options to charge appropriately either. 

<-- to me, all of the above (relationships/products) hint at the same: we don't practice care-taking, so when things don't go so well, we don't know what healing/repairing practice to engage in... to, me they are deeply realted"

### Land - colonialism
For many of us it is easier to imagine that a country needs more land to do something rather than rework the relationship to the current land
