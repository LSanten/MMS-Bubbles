It blew my mind to realize that renewable energy systems require 2000-7000% more minerals to deliver the same amount of energy compared with the current fossil-fuel technologies (see an article here). Electric vehicles require 400% more minerals. To convert our current energy systems as planned by Western governments, we would face the largest increase of production of metals in human history (I can recommend this interesting video by Mills). This is because all Western governments plan on increasing energy consumption during the transition to "renewable" energy. The question always remains, is it actually sustainabale to take apart our planet to mine even more resources to build green technology?
