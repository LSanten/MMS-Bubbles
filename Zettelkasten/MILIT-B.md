### **[Climate Crossfire: How NATO’s 2% military spending targets contribute to climate breakdown](https://www.tni.org/en/publication/climate-crossfire)**

- at least 5.5% of all GHG emissions are emitted by global military (not including conflict emissions)
- world-wide military spendings increased 21% since 2013
- the military is used increasingly to *push away* climate migrants and social uprisings due to climate injustice (also see Slide on Arms exports from wealthy countries to climate vulnerable countries)

Relative to Israel's size, it is the largest arms dealer. Spends 24 bln dollar / a year on military. The US department of Defense is the second largest employer world-wide, and per capita, it is more than 4x larger than the Indian defence department (which is the largest employer world-wide) [[MILIT-A]].

climate change is being talked about as a "security threat" to national security. Threat to operations of the military (sea bases), or poor countries becoming a threat to rich countries due to conflict and migration - so migration needs to be controlled. 

ANNOTATION: colors above should be flipped.
