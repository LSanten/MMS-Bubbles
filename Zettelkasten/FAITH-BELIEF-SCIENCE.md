"We must here make a clear distinction between belief and faith, because, in geenral practice, blief has come to mean a state of mind which is almost the opposite of faith. Belief as I use the word here, is the insistence that the trugh is wahte one would "lief" or wish to be. The believer will open his mind to the truth on condition that it fits in with his preconceived ideas and wishes. Faith, on the other hand, is an unreserved opening of the mind to the truth, whatever it may turn out to be. **Faith has no preconceptions; it is a plunge into the unknown. Belief clings, but faith lets go. In this sense of the word, faith is the essential virtue of science, and likewise of any religion that is not self-deception.**" (Alan Watts 2011)
