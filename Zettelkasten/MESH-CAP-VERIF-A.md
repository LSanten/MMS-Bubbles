# How do I verify my work and project ideas?

Verification is part of the [creative process](https://www.wework.com/ideas/professional-development/creativity-culture/understanding-the-four-stages-of-the-creative-process#:~:text=Stage%204%3A%20Verification&text=Whatever%20ideas%20and%20insights%20arose,such%20an%20orderly%2C%20linear%20fashion).

I can rate Ideas by using the [New, Appeal, and Feasibility (NAF) method](https://www.mycoted.com/NAF).

Another crucial aspect of verification is critical reflection: that is, a deliberate effort to question the assumptions that underpin your ideas, and to check these assumptions against the dominant discourse(s) relevant to your project area. Is your project informed by assumptions that regurgitate the dominant discourse, or challenge it?

As an extension of this critical reflection, we encourage you to ask yourself who pays, and who benefits in the context of your project. As you have learned throughout MESH, this line of inquiry follows the work of Ursula Franklin, and you can read more about it in this article: [International Humanitarian Engineering: Who Benefits, and Who Pays?](https://app.omprakash.org/Classroom%20pdfs/International_humanitarian_engineering_1699061872.pdf).

My creation ideas that should be rated are summarized in [[MESH-CAP-G]] and [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1NwWqKLH4x-LrfgwC4PKYaQwBhMZNnYlpEaP_w2SmreI/edit#heading=h.n0g8ynedxiwk).
