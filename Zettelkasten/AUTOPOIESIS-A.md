# The essence of our social systems is reproduced in the structures they create
We can think of the newly arising structures as potential fruits. 
We can think of the essence of our social systems as the code or ontological primitives (smallest building blocks of what we consider valuable, reality, purpose, and sacred [[ONTOLOGICAL-PRIMITIVES]]).

**From a conversation with Dhara on LinkedIn:** I resonate with your insights to reflect on the values embedded in our work. I have found that knowing the term "ontological primitives" is helpful in encapsulating the importance of "values, purpose, and the sense of the sacred" as the essence that resurfaces throughout the projects/structures we create - and especially once our projects take off on their own; gain life force. For instance, we might build a structure (app/company) with the intention of earning fruits (human connections based on creativity). The fruits bring new energy and life to the world. The new sprouts contain a seed with a similar DNA (essence = ontological primitives) from which the structure (or tree) has grown. Since the power of the seed or essence cannot always be seen at first glance in all parts of the tree, it helps to have the awareness that the essence of our work will eventually re-appear in the next structures that grow from the seeds in the new fruits.
