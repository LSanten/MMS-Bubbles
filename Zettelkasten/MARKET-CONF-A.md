# IDEA: create a market to open space to surface meaningful "bubbles" of interest to the community and elicit conversation 
This market could allow people to share the following:

**how may we support each other?**
- offers 
- needs

**how may we learn from and collaborate with each other?**
- *questions* that emerged from the talks/conference
- *insights/concepts* that seem important or have emerged from the conference
- *ideas/proposals* regarding opportunties or collaboration
- *unmet needs* from the event
- how the conference could do better 

the list above is inspired by my design prototype for my personal "bubble" sharing and collaboration website.

## Concrete ideas: what forms of wall space or room space to create
Below is a collection of space design concepts to enable the asynchronous (not necessarily in person) communication about needs to connect. 

This is essentially a deeper split-up of a "needs" section. I am unsure if this division is necessary. It might help to streamline communication as some orgs or people are interested in very specific forms of collaboration or work. 

### "You may reach out to me when you or your org is interested in talking or building movement in the spaces of..."
The focus of this space would be to get to know each other and connect over shared interests or movement building efforts. This space could be created by seting up wall space where people can introduce themselves on large sticky notes with their interests or asks/needs and offers. They may add phone numbers or other ways to contact them throughout the conference. (little idea on top: option to pay for a quick printout of their face could be added)

### "Seeking collaborators in ..."
This space is slightly different from movement building as it focuses on concrete collaborations. For instance, someone may have the need for a software programmer or a visual artist to collaborate on an already existing project. 

### "This is who we are, and we need these nutrients"
This visualization would be more focused on summarizing the identity of a whole org or person. An entity can put up their name and add a sticky note for every nutrient/need they have. This could also be accompanied by a section for offers. 

## Concepts embedded in this market practice

### buildings relationships naturally by engaging witht the market structure

### synthesis of collective wisdom, struggle, urges etc - like Chat GPT
What would a neural network knwo that had only been trained on the insights and contents from the conference? What would be the concepts that could be synthesized from the event? 

What questions do people go home with?
