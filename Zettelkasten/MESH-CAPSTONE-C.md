# IDEA: Bulletin board for emotions, needs, and offers on a virtual plaza

Imagine a visual 2-dimensional interface (similar to miro) but organized more neatly. There is a row, like a bulletin board, where people post their emotions. These emotions start to fade after a week or two.

There is another row for un-met needs. They can range from "I need help talking with my mom about Palestine" to "I seek conversation buddy for my capstone." And a third row is about offerings. Mahtaub, for instance, has offered in the past to be a conversation buddy to anyone who would like to talk. Essentially, we have a bulletin for our micro-village. It's like a marketplace or plaza.Â
