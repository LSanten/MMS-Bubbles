# It is normal to not know until we know
Kids know that they cannot possibly know how to navigate the world or know about a topic until they learn. Why do we feel so insecure about this process as we grow?

- do we have a model of ourselves to have reached a state of knowing enough adult-knowledge?
- do we infer about our worth and identity as soon as we make a mistakes or don't know because we identify with our knowledge?

## the educational focus on knowledge instead of how to work with knowledge
There seems to be a big problematic divergence here. We teach knowledge all the time. But we teach very little about how to deal with this knowledge; how to relate to this knowledge. (relationships vs reduced points of knowledge). 

--> this point informs the effort to think about [[KNOWLEDGE-ORGANIZATION-A]]
--> it is okay to not know. it is only important to be willing to adapt and change.
