# An app for friends where we share intentions for the week and spontaneous trips

for instance, if I feel excited to go out tonight, I can let everyone in my circle know. Maybe someone else will jump on the train with me: "Leon wants to dance right now. Do you want to join them?"

If I have a plan to do a lot of crocheing in the next week or two, I can let people know. Maybe this will motivate someone else to crochet with me.

like a radar to know who goes out when. A radar where you can enable to be seen by your friends for a certain time: *track me down if you like mode*.
