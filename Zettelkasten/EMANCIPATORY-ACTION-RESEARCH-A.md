"Creating critical spaces for dialogue is important, involving all co-participants  in co-creating knowledge for our times. These are counter-hegemonic critical  spaces where power relationships are investigated and deconstructed in order  to act to reconstruct democratic relations with new possibilities for a world  that is fair and just. This concept of a democratic public space is a vital context  for social justice as a site for critical dialogue and participation in the process  of participatory democracy (Habermas, 1989)" (Ledwith 2017, p. 56)

"Critique and dissent are central to the deepening of democracy;  critiquing the status quo opens the space to transform the present into a better  future. In these ways, EAR contextualises personal lives within the political,  social, and economic structures of our times (Kemmis, 2006). And, to have a  sustainable impact on social change, it needs to extend beyond individuals and  groups “to build systemic pictures of what is going on, and systemic intervention strategies, developing multiple inquiries that engage whole systems in on-  going cycles of inquiry” (Burns, 2007)" (Ledwith 2017, p. 56)
