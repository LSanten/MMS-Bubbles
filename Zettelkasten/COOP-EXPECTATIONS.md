if we tie our contentment to the outcome of our work, we run the risk of creating work containers that are not sustainable in the present moment. We might create work containers and structures that are not conducive to wellbeing. If the process of work is not conducive to wellbeing and only the intended end goal, we get attached to an outcome, which is dangerous because things never go the way we expect.
