# Introduction to the evolution of a mechanical music visualizer using a laser



## Skiis at Fault radio with laser in the background Sept 18 2022
This was a larger event with several DJs, vendors, and artist. In [this YouTube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yF6J6Qs61sM), Skiis DJs with the laser in the background. **The laser's movement in [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yF6J6Qs61sM) is particularly fun because it bounces around** based on the base of the music. I received enthusiam from a few peopel as they had never seen a visual that didn't use a screen or visual before.
