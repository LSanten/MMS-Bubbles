# A cute sharing ideas among friends platform

This idea is inspired by my natural excitemetn to share fun ideas with friends. For instance, right now I want to share with Odalys that I think it could be so cute and fun to have a platformt to share my idea for an app with her. I can text her and that's sweet. But maybe I want to share this idea with more people. And maybe we want to build this idea over time and keep it archived for later usage. 

I like how my riend Vicki it. They like to conceptualize working together like this as a framework for "direct action" in the mental space. 

I can envision different parts of this platform/medium

- sharing ideas
- sharing insights 
- (always sharing the idea with someone, tagging people you think might like it or resonate with it - for ideas and for insightssd)
