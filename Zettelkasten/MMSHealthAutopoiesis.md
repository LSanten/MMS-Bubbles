"Yeah i think both quotes resonated with me-in particular the first quote about how engineers disconnected from their own needs wonâ€™t produce technologies that can heal the planet -i was reminded of my undergrad engineering experience and how disconnected i felt from myself during that time. I felt that the culture in engineering felt very much colder and very separate from oneself, or that may have been just my experience in engineering at the least"
