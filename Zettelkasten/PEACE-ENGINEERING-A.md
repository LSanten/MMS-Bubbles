# Peace engineering requires engineers to be integrated into the commuity
Peace Engineering recognizes that the technical solutions needed for a more peaceful, equitable, and sustainable future for all require engineers to be integrated into community development methodologies and processes that engineers typically avoid, oftentimes to the detriment of the initiative. In practice, peace engineering is most important about integrating the knowledge of engineers through transdisciplinary processes, into community development efforts that include conflict dynamics, which is prevalent in all informal settlements by their very nature.
