# What are ontological primitives?
Ontological primitives are the essences from which our actions and behaviors arise. They are the smallest building blocks of ontolgocial base understandings (regarding the nature of reality & being) such as:

- value
- purpose
- sense of the sacred

(McGilchrist 2021) - [[MCGILCHRIST2021-VID]]

*maybe one can say that we need to "meet" in all these domains to connect with each other fully*

## As ontological primitives contition our behvairos and actions, they condition the social and physical structures we create. These structures, then, reproduce the ontological primitives in an autopoietic fashion
see [[AUTOPOIESIS-A]] for the concept of re-creation
see [[MMSSocialReproduction]] for ways in which current paradigms re-appear in (engineering) education
